# Visual Jujutsu

## Introduction

This project is an fzf based TUI wrapper around the version control system [Jujutsu]. It's meant to be visual/interctive `jj log` where configurable actions can be performed on the focused/selected revisions.
It's based on a [shell script prototype] which is in turn based on previous fzf based Jujutsu TUIs. While a full blown standalone Jujutsu TUI would be great to have, these experiments showed that an fzf based solution can be an excellent stand in until then.
